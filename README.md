# moldflow_automation
  This is the automation process of moldflow with a python code. This code allows users to use the advantages of Moldflow without a GUI. This will be used in my Master Thesis on "Data-driven parameter identification for processing of Sheet Molding Compounds".

  Determining the rheological properties of SMC materials is requires complex methods and expensive tools. This projects aims to reduce the time and costs of this process by implementing a Data-driven approach. With the data gathered from the hot press we can create a model that predicts rehological properties of the materials. 

  I will be trying to create a automation process that calculates new parameters with each loop and run another simulation on Moldflow till the error is minimal. Moldflow API's are great for creating a workflow like this! When the coding of the Optimization/Simulation is done we can start working with real-life data from the press and create a model that imitates the real press behaviours.
